# 🐛 Bug Fix Summary - Gignaati Workbench

## Issues Fixed in This Release

---

### 🐛 **Bug #1: Loading Screen Cut Off**

**Problem:**
- Loading screen was being cut off at the edges
- Content not fully visible on smaller displays
- Window size too small (600x500)

**Root Cause:**
- Fixed window dimensions in `electron-main.js`
- Container padding too large
- No responsive width

**Solution:**
✅ Increased window size from 600x500 to 800x600
✅ Changed `transparent: true` to `transparent: false` for better compatibility
✅ Added responsive width (90%) to loading container
✅ Adjusted padding from 40px to 40px 20px

**Files Changed:**
- `electron-main.js` (lines 16-17, 19)
- `loading-screen.html` (lines 27-30)

### 🐛 **Bug #2: System Detection Stuck on "Detecting..."**

**Problem:**
- System requirements modal shows "Detecting..." forever
- No progress after 3+ minutes
- Console error: `No handler registered for 'detect-system-full'`

**Root Cause:**
- IPC handler `detect-system-full` was registered in `src/main/main.js`
- But the actual entry point is `electron-main.js`
- Handler was never loaded

**Solution:**
✅ Added `detect-system-full` IPC handler to `electron-main.js`
✅ Includes fallback data if detection fails
✅ Returns comprehensive system info with performance tier

**Files Changed:**
- `electron-main.js` (lines 51-79, new handler added)

**Handler Returns:**
```javascript
{
  cpu: { model, cores, speed },
  gpu: { model, vram, type, vendor },
  memory: { total, free, used, usagePercent },
  performance: {
    tier: 'PREMIUM/STANDARD/BASIC',
    recommendedModels: [...],
    maxModelSize: '7B',
    performance: { category, tokensPerSec, description }
  }
}
```

### 🐛 **Bug #3: Ollama Installer Not Found (ENOENT)**

**Problem:**
- Error: `spawn C:\...\resources\binaries\OllamaSetup.exe ENOENT`
- Installer file doesn't exist
- Installation fails immediately

**Root Cause:**
- Code expected `OllamaSetup.exe` in `resources/binaries/` folder
- This folder and file don't exist in the project
- No bundled installer

**Solution:**
✅ **Download installer on-demand** instead of bundling
✅ Use PowerShell to download from official Ollama website
✅ Run installer silently with `/VERYSILENT` flag
✅ Auto-cleanup after installation
✅ Works for Windows, macOS, and Linux

**New Approach:**
```javascript
// Windows
PowerShell downloads OllamaSetup.exe from ollama.com
→ Runs with silent flags
→ Deletes temp file after install

// macOS/Linux
Uses official install script: curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No need to bundle 200MB+ installer
- ✅ Always gets latest version
- ✅ Smaller app size
- ✅ Cross-platform compatible

**Files Changed:**
- `src/main/ollama-manager.js` (completely rewritten)
