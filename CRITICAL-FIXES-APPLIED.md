## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Ollama Models NOT Appearing in N8N (CRITICAL - FIXED!)

**Problem**: Downloaded Ollama models were not visible in N8N's Ollama Chat Model nodes.

**Root Cause**: N8N requires explicit credential configuration in its database. Even though `OLLAMA_HOST` environment variable was set, N8N's Ollama nodes need credentials added to the `credentials_entity` table.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created `n8n-credential-injector.js` module
- Auto-injects Ollama credentials into N8N SQLite database on first launch
- Credentials include:
  - Base URL: `http://localhost:11434`
  - Type: `ollamaApi`
  - Encrypted using N8N's encryption key
  - Shared with default user/project

**Files Modified**:
- ✅ `/src/main/n8n-credential-injector.js` (NEW)
- ✅ `/electron-main.js` (added credential injection after N8N starts)

**How It Works**:
1. N8N starts and database is initialized
2. After 3-second delay (to ensure DB is ready), credential injector runs
3. Checks if Ollama credentials already exist
4. If not, creates encrypted credential with localhost:11434
5. Shares credential with default project
6. Models now appear in N8N's Ollama nodes automatically!

### 2. ✅ Download Progress UI Not Showing (FIXED!)

**Problem**: User reported progress only visible in terminal, not in UI.

**Analysis**: Progress WAS actually working in code, but needed better visibility and polish.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created `download-manager-improved.js` with enhanced progress UI
- Floating progress container in top-right corner
- Shows:
  - Model name
  - Progress bar (animated, striped)
  - Percentage
  - Downloaded size
  - Download speed
  - ETA (estimated time remaining)
  - Cancel button

**Files Modified**:
- ✅ `/download-manager-improved.js` (NEW)
- ✅ `/index.html` (added script include)
- ✅ `/electron-main.js` (updated to send `details` in progress callback)

---

### 3. ✅ Cancel Button for Downloads (IMPLEMENTED!)

**Problem**: No way to cancel an ongoing model download.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added `activeDownloads` Map to track running downloads
- Implemented `cancelDownload(modelName)` method in ollama-manager
- Added IPC handler `cancel-model-download`
- Exposed `cancelDownload` API in preload.js
- Cancel button in progress UI kills the download process

**Files Modified**:
- ✅ `/src/main/ollama-manager.js` (added activeDownloads tracking + cancelDownload method)
- ✅ `/electron-main.js` (added cancel-model-download IPC handler)
- ✅ `/preload.js` (exposed cancelDownload API)
- ✅ `/download-manager-improved.js` (cancel button UI and logic)

**How It Works**:
1. User clicks "Cancel" button in progress UI
2. Calls `window.electronAPI.cancelDownload(modelName)`
3. Main process kills the `ollama pull` process with SIGTERM
4. Download state cleaned up
5. Button re-enabled for retry

---

### 4. ✅ "Already Setup" Status (IMPLEMENTED!)

**Problem**: No indication which models are already downloaded.

**Solution Implemented**:
- `initializeDownloadManager()` runs on page load
- Calls `window.electronAPI.listModels()` to get installed models
- Marks downloaded models with:
  - Button text: "✓ Already Setup"
  - Button style: Green (btn-success)
  - Button disabled
  - Badge: "Installed"

**Files Modified**:
- ✅ `/download-manager-improved.js` (added `markModelAsInstalled()` function)

**How It Works**:
1. Page loads → `initializeDownloadManager()` runs
2. Fetches list of installed models from Ollama
3. Finds all download buttons with `data-model` attribute
4. Updates UI for already-downloaded models
5. Prevents duplicate downloads

---

### 5. ✅ Download Button State Management (FIXED!)

**Problem**: Button not disabled during download, allowing multiple simultaneous downloads.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Global `downloadStates` Map tracks each model's download state
- States: `idle`, `downloading`, `complete`, `failed`
- Button disabled during download
- Spinner shown during download
- Progress percentage shown in button text
- Button re-enabled only on completion or error

**Files Modified**:
- ✅ `/download-manager-improved.js` (comprehensive state management)

**States Tracked**:
```javascript
{
  status: 'downloading' | 'complete' | 'failed',
  progress: 0-100,
  button: HTMLButtonElement,
  container: HTMLDivElement (progress UI)
}
```

---

### 6. ✅ N8N Sign-in Button Not Working (FIXED!)

**Problem**: Form submission not working in embedded iframe.

**Root Cause**: Iframe security restrictions blocking form submission.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added proper `sandbox` attributes to iframe:
  - `allow-same-origin` - Allow same-origin access
  - `allow-scripts` - Allow JavaScript execution
  - `allow-forms` - **Allow form submission** (KEY FIX!)
  - `allow-popups` - Allow popups if needed
  - `allow-modals` - Allow modal dialogs
  - `allow-downloads` - Allow file downloads

**Files Modified**:
- ✅ `/index.html` (added sandbox attributes to both N8N iframes)

**Before**:
```javascript
const iframe = document.createElement('iframe');
iframe.src = 'http://localhost:5678';
```

**After**:
```javascript
const iframe = document.createElement('iframe');
iframe.src = 'http://localhost:5678';
iframe.setAttribute('sandbox', 'allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-forms allow-popups allow-modals allow-downloads');
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Ollama credentials not appearing in N8N
**Solution**:
1. Check console logs for credential injection errors
2. Verify N8N database exists: `<userData>/n8n-data/database.sqlite`
3. Delete database and restart app to trigger fresh credential injection
4. Check if user/project exists in N8N database

### Issue: Download progress not showing
**Solution**:
1. Open DevTools console (Ctrl+Shift+I)
2. Check for JavaScript errors
3. Verify `download-manager-improved.js` is loaded
4. Check if `window.electronAPI.onModelDownloadProgress` is defined

### Issue: Cancel button not working
**Solution**:
1. Check console for errors when clicking cancel
2. Verify `window.electronAPI.cancelDownload` is defined
3. Check if `activeDownloads` Map has the model entry
4. Verify ollama process is killable (not zombie process)

### Issue: Models not showing "Already Setup"
**Solution**:
1. Check if `window.electronAPI.listModels` returns data
2. Verify Ollama is running
3. Check if models are actually downloaded: `ollama list` in terminal
4. Verify download buttons have `data-model` attribute

### Issue: N8N sign-in still not working
**Solution**:
1. Check browser console for iframe security errors
2. Verify sandbox attributes are applied: Inspect iframe element
3. Try opening N8N directly in browser: `http://localhost:5678`
4. Check N8N logs for authentication errors
